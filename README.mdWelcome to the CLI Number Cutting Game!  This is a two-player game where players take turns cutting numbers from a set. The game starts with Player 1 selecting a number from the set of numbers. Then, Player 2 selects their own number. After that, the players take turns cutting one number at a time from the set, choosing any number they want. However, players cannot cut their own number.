Welcome to the CLI Number Cutting Game!
This is a two-player game where players take turns cutting numbers from a set. The game starts with Player 1 selecting a number from the set of numbers. Then, Player 2 selects their own number. After that, the players take turns cutting one number at a time from the set, choosing any number they want. However, players cannot cut their own number.
The game continues until one player's chosen number is cut, and that player wins.
